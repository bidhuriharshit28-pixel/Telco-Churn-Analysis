# Insights from Telco Churn Analysis

#Churn Rate

A significant percentage of customers discontinue services, indicating the need for stronger retention strategies.

#Customer Demographics

Senior citizens and customers with lower tenure show higher churn rates.

Customers who do not opt for long-term contracts (monthly contracts) are more likely to churn.

#Service Usage Patterns

Customers without additional services (like Online Security, Tech Support, or Streaming TV/Movies) are more likely to leave.

Fiber optic internet users have higher churn compared to DSL users, possibly due to cost or service issues.

#Payment & Billing Factors

Customers using electronic checks show a higher tendency to churn compared to those using credit cards, bank transfers, or automatic payments.

High monthly charges are strongly correlated with churn, showing that pricing is a critical factor.

#Contract Type

Month-to-month contract customers churn the most.

Annual or two-year contracts significantly reduce churn as they increase customer stickiness.

#Business Implications

To reduce churn, the company should:

Offer incentives for long-term contracts.

Improve service quality for fiber optic internet.

Provide discounts or loyalty rewards to high-billing customers.

Promote bundled services (security, support, streaming) to increase engagement.
